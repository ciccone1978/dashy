# Dashy
## Under development
Purpose of this project: learning the python flask framework.

(For now) a basic dashboard built using python flask and AdminLTE3 w/ login and user registration.

# Roadmap
What I'm going to do?

Maybe a [Garmin Connect](https://connect.garmin.com/) clone to track sport activities and health stats.
